      "After ten happy, successful and highly educational years, I've decided to leave my role as [Chief Technology Officer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/barryfrost) at [Venntro](https://venntro.com) this month. After so long with the company I felt the need to shake myself out of my comfort zone and look for a fresh challenge. \r\n\r\nI'm very excited about joining a new company where I can use my experiences creating high performance development teams, building a large B2C subscription platform and leading technology for an award-winning and profitable fast-growth business.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for a CTO / VP of Engineering / Head of Development etc. in South-West London, North Surrey or along the M4 Corridor (or know of someone who is) I'd love to [talk](/contact). I'm planning to first enjoy some time at home with our [newborn](/2018/02/hello-to-my-son-charlie), but I'll be open to new opportunities from the end of May.\r\n\r\nAnd of course, I wish founders Ross and Steve and the whole of Venntro continued success for the future. I'm confident the platform is in very good hands with Ian as Venntro's new Head of Technology leading a great team of superb developers."
